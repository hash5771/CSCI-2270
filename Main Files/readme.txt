This project is a mini version control system that accepts numerous file types.
The user can initialize a new repository, choose to add, delete, and commit changes.
At any point, the user is able to see all past commits and files but loses the ability to add, delete, or commit new files until they return to the most recent commit
cin does not account for strings being added instead of numbers
